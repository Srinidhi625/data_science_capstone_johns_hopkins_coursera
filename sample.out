schrodinger came into my life years ago when a tiny kitten showed up on my doorstep one day he was weak starving dehydrated and limping from a broken leg and he had an infected gash on the back of his head i took him to the vet who told me he probably wouldnt live through the night he was about months old at the time the doctor said it was pointless to try to save him and that he should be euthanized but when i looked in those little green eyes i just couldnt do it i asked the doctor if there was anything he could do no matter how pointless it seemed he said he could try some iv fluids and nutrition and some antibiotics for the infection but it would be expensive he said and it would be silly to spend that kind of money on a feral kitten that probably wouldnt live anyway

we know that the fifth fleet in bahrain patrols the borders between iran and bahrain bahrain is a strategic point and important to the us we also know that the eu and us have been pushing iran to allow the international atomic energy agency iaea to do a follow up on iran to gather evidence that iran has its nuclear plant to provide nuclear energy without building nuclear weapons every time this question is brought up iran doesnt care about what the international community thinks it reached a point where in late february israel made it clear that the program is on going and iran is still building nuclear weapons the eu are asking the un to continue to put pressure on iran to the point where the us put sactions on iran to force them to stop their nuclear program so far the us is a big enemy to iran and vice versa it seems like the us didnt intend to hand iraq over to the persians to control but… this is the part that really sucks…the latest release of wikileaks’ gi files that consists of million emails is quite scary to even read and here’s why

i’m about to confess something…i watch glee please don’t judge me but in my recent viewing of glee well really in any viewing of glee you come to the realization that there are several things happening something serious that the show addresses and something that is overly dramatic that shouldn’t be that the show either addresses comically or seriously and sometimes the writers poorly write too many issues into one episode instead of spreading them out for a season which you can actually criticize them for writing issues into plot points that seem forced in the first place but that’s besides the point while i’m watching this episode i’ve come to the realization that some of the characters make a big hairy deal over some things that are just not that important while at the same time there is actual pain occurring in the “more” serious issue for someone else

a man is judged by his friends a man is judged by those he associates with and a man is judged by those he supports therefore it is only reasonable and fair that anyone that supported the anc over the past hundred years be judged by his support of the anc it also then stands to reason that anyone who supports and finances terrorists must be a terrorist himself even if he does try to disguise the terrorists by calling them freedom fighters

so whats the problem here why shouldnt police protect the feelings and racial sensitivities of muslim men above those of vulnerable teenage white girls i mean these poor downtrodden men all struggling to live in western countries deserve a little compassion from the police and social workers the victims were only white girls who probably deserved what happened to them as long as the new muslim immigrants feel good about living in the uk and their sexual deviations met then their crimes deserve to be overlooked just so that the police and social services dont appear to be racist are you kidding me even after the first girl reported her rape to the police in they ignored her one of the girls was raped by men in one evening and still the police were to frightened to act in case they were seen to be racist so they let these victims suffer and let even more girls become victims all so that they could come away with clean racial hands even while these muslim perverts were treating these girls like easy sexual meat this is what our society has been reduced to i hope all liberals out there who use racism as a way to denigrate white people are all very proud of themselves political correctness is a weapon of the liberals socialist and marxists they have used it over the decades to turn us in particular the white race into a bunch of pansies too scared to look after our own in case we are subjected to cries of racism this is the result up to vulnerable white young teenage girls ignored by the system which is there to protect them from such perverts all so that a few officers and case workers and even a lawyer are not seen to be racist i hope you are all proud of yourselves you bunch of lillylivered cowards and the irony is that its a fellow muslim chief crown prosecutor nazir afzal who decided to open the case against these men apparently he didnt feel any guilt about catching and skewering these bastards
i have to wait for pathology reports they cant come back any faster so what do i do with the anxiety i try and offer it up this means i offer these feelings and doubts to jesus on the cross i just give them to him and ask him to unite my little baby sufferings with his holy sufferings and by doing this there is purpose and meaning in my trials i think if i am to progress in my spiritual life i must try and imitate jesus in any way i know he suffered and was greatly troubled in the garden when i join my unnerving wait for test results to his passion my wait can become redemptive and useful and serve to draw me closer to him so i took all my emotional torment cupped it in my hands and gave it away

update th december as commented on here last week it is now confirmed as mary carolan at the irish times reports that the dalys’ case against nama has been settled save as to the issue of costs – and on the issue of costs it is reported there is to be no costs order against nama which doesn’t look very promising for the dalys apparently neither side is commenting and the terms of the settlement are confidential so there but what this means is that nama is now apparently unencumbered in any sale of the daly assets to which receivers were appointed six months ago and in the very near term it might mean that bond street is sold by receivers possibly to existing tenant louis vuitton moet hennessy lvmh speculation about the price suggests the property may fetch €m gbp m
its no secret that saundra mitchells gothic novel the vespertine was one of my favorite novels of im a romantic at heart and drawn to all kinds of anachronisms and to me the vespertine was a book that wonderfully and amazingly just didnt fit in didnt quite belong amidst all the other young adult books i was reading and thats a huge part of why i loved saundras book and her ethereal writing style quite so much ive recommended the vespertine to so many people and talked extensively about it here so when i received a copy of the springsweet for an arc tour i was thrilled and elated and i also had high hopes for the sequel to the vespertine it being zora stewarts story the springsweet picks up right at a year after the events of the vespertine and its not a lie to say that when i read the opening passages i felt like id come home back to saundras beautiful writing

i found out that many religious preachers although some of them may have good intentions have let the word act in the manner where it has hurt individuals at most and i am not sure if that is always unintended at least a large amount of evangelical preachers do not seem too concerned about how their teachings and judgmental attitudes are received or even how it damage the individual but they surely must see and be aware of the effects of their preachings for while they condemn the act in itself the homosexual behavior they often say that they “hate the sin but love the sinner” but somehow i cannot get rid of that creepy feeling that they don’t distinguish between the act and the person who performs it even if they want us to believe the opposite why do christians so often say that frase especially when talking about homosexuality you won’t find this quote in the jewish bible nor in the christian bible i am absolutely sure about that

we are animals it’s best not to water it down but to recognize how cognitively uncomfortable it makes us to selfidentify in this way have you ever noticed how easy it is to have an ahha moment and how difficult it is to incorporate the implications of that moment into your own daily life this phenomenon would surely be less ubiquitous than it is if we were in fact creatures of rationality but the truth is that this consciousverbal cognition that we experience that we generally identify as our ‘self’ is only one small part of us and contrary to contemporary mythology it is not in control in his book the happiness hypothesis jonathan haidt develops the metaphor of the rider and the elephant to explore the realities of what he calls ‘the divided self’ as he puts it “i can direct things but only when the elephant doesn’t have desires of his own when the elephant really wants to do something i’m no match for him”

similarly for ethiopia the massive amount of water generated by the huge annual rainfall but the fact that nearly all of the bcm flowed to neighboring states prompted until the last decade the “sovereign right” position to use the waters within its territory for its own national development for ethiopia the loss of huge volumes of soil in the annual flood also underlined the fact that it could be resource rich and poor at the same time unless the resources could be harnessed more effectively the nature of dependence on resources received externally against internal renewable resources is illustrated in figure see original publication

but there’s a second type of reward for longtime viewers and that comes in the form of character consistency longrunning characters in soaps typically get plotlines or moments where what is significant is not a specific reference to their history but rather the fact that they act in a manner consistent with their character type the most charming moment along these lines in the month i watched was when annie walker the landlady at the rovers return the requisite and iconic pub chats up the obligatory punk rocker character and gets along with him well a moment that is fun primarily because annie walker has been on the show since the first episode and it reconfirms her defining character traits of being gracious and discerning what’s significant about this that even though it is not a moment that depends on any longterm knowledge of the show it’s still one that rewards it it’s significant primarily if you have a builtup appreciation of annie walker a similar moment appears in the first episode of december in which hilda ogden a character defined in no small part by her ability to irritate everybody else in the show is shut out from a wedding reception annie gives her an opportunity to pick up a shift working at the inn giving her a tacit invitation another small character moment that is endearing because of the existence of prior investment in the characters as opposed to because of its own intrinsic dramatic tension

arriving at the pass i parked and entered into a two story high tower observatory the tower was made of the same black and red porous rock i tunneled through on the road up here from sisters inside the observatory i found that some considerate groups of local business people were kind enough to erect a brass map and guide to the sites from the observatory grant’s pass and this observatory of the same name stood directly on the continental divide the large brass map pointed out the mountain peaks with arrows and lines of bearing so that you could clearly identify the peak the day was cloudless clear and of moderate september temperature i could easily see and identify the peaks from this vantage point and i learned that the first mountain i saw to my left while driving up the pass was black crater brochures in the observatory’s lower level showed the trail map up to the top of black crater how marvelously accommodating were those local business persons i thought before me was the map of my route up to the top of black crater where i will find my spirit guide the events of the last hours were all leading me here to the observatory at grant’s pass and this brochure in my hand i could feel my spirit guide call to me it was reaching out to me and calling me to the top of black crater it was all clearly laid out before me
