2. The Objective
========================================================

- This presentation shows a overview of the final project of Data Science Specialization.
- The main objective of this project is create a aplication with predictive text model. 
- For this task, it is necessary to create an aplication that receives a phrase and returns a prediction word. 


3. Aplication Screen
========================================================

- The user interface of this application was designed with **Web First** in mind.
- (**1**) First enter the phrase in the text field,
